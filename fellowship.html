                            Impact Canada launched the Fellowship program to attract external talent with specialized skills and expertise. The program supports departments and agencies by building capacity to apply innovative, outcomes-based financing approaches, new partnership models, impact measurement methodologies, and social science insights to priority areas.

                          <p>The Fellowship Program bridges expertise gaps in areas such as research, data analysis, and policy design. By recruiting specialists from around the world, the program provides departments with the expertise needed to accelerate priority initiatives.

                  Impact Canada’s model is designed to complement partner departments’ existing expertise in a manner that maximizes efficiency of resources. Together, Impact Canada’s Centre of Expertise and host organizations establish goals and determine project scope and approach. Once a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) is in place, the Centre of Expertise helps guide projects,  leveraging the Fellowship program to ensure the teams have the right skills at the right time to achieve success.

                <p>Fellows’ placements are tailored to match their strengths and operational needs of the project.</p>

                            Fellows are typically embedded in host departments, where they receive the support, tools, workspace, and resources required to succeed in their roles. Departmental partners assume day-to-day oversight of embedded Fellows’ work and provide leadership and direction to them. Fellows work alongside the Impact Canada Centre of Expertise. This direct connection is maintained to supplement the guidance provided to Fellows, leverage internal and centrally positioned expertise, and enhance  research and translation of findings into  actionable policy, program and regulatory recommendations.

                            Impact Canada Fellows are recruited as term employees by the Privy Council Office (PCO), with technical expertise in their respective domains. Fellows serve as skilled specialists in research design, methodologies, data analysis, impact measurement, and knowledge translation, contributing to projects that accelerate progress in priority areas. We recruit Fellows from around the world, with applicants from as far as India, Japan, and New Zealand, creating opportunities for Canadian Citizens, permanent residents, and work visa/permit holders.

                  Impact Canada's team implements the Fellowship program, including running efficient and robust recruitment campaigns, assessing candidates on technical skills. We aim for a 90-day target for our recruitment campaigns, from launch to establishing a pool of pre-qualified candidates. To date, we have completed 12 campaigns, with an average campaign length of 77 days. Providing this resourcing solution centrally eliminates the need for individual departments to run multiple [and overlapping] recruitment campaigns, creating a more efficient and streamlined process.
                </p>   
                <p>Impact Canada Fellows receive comprehensive onboarding, providing them with tools and connections for early and ongoing success, tailored to their host department placement. Onboarding is designed to define and achieve goals from the perspectives of Fellows, host managers, and home managers, integrating the new Fellow into the program’s broad and interdisciplinary cohort.</p>
