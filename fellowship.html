                            To help deliver on Impact Canada’s service offerings, the Fellowship program recruits top-tier external talent to accelerate progress on priority initiatives for government. Fellows provide skills and expertise in areas like outcomes-based financing, sludge audits, and advanced data and behavioural science analytics. They are recruited from across the country, bringing fresh ideas, diverse perspectives and critical expertise to help government deliver better services, faster.  

                          </p>
                          <p>We recruit based on specialized skills - not years of experience. With a 90-day target for recruitment campaigns, our efficient, streamlined process ensures that we can onboard Fellows with the right skills at the right time, eliminating the need for departments to run overlapping or lengthy hiring processes.

                            FThe Fellowship program is an important component of the Impact Canada Centre of Expertise. Fellows are recruited as term employees of the Privy Council Office (PCO) and depending on the specific initiative, can sometimes embed directly into departments to support policy implementation. Importantly, this model allows our partners to access specialized skills without adding to their permanent headcount.
